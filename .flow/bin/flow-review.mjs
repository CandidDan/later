// flow-review.mjs — the deterministic half of the review gate (flow-0007).
//
// The three Definition-of-Done reviewers — qa, code-review, security — used to run as subagents
// INSIDE the worker's own session, which made the worker the certifier of its own work. Every
// other guard in Flow refuses to do that: touches-guard enforces scope in CI, the store-guard
// fails a PR that edits task state, flow-doctor validates the store. The reviewers now run the
// same way, as jobs on the PR (`_flow-review.yml`).
//
// A model call cannot be the whole gate, though, because a model call always exits 0. Two pieces
// have to be real code, and they live here:
//
//   plan     — reads `review:` out of the caller repo's .flow/config.yml, decides whether the
//              conditional security review applies to THIS diff, and materialises the bounded
//              context (changed files + a size-capped diff) the reviewers are allowed to read.
//              That bound is what keeps per-PR cost flat as the codebase grows; left to a prompt
//              it erodes silently, because a reviewer that read the whole repo still looks fine.
//   verdict  — turns a reviewer's written verdict into an exit code. FAIL-CLOSED: a missing,
//              empty or unparseable verdict is a failure, never a pass. A reviewer that died
//              mid-run must not read as approval — that is the one bug that would make this
//              whole gate theatre. So is a PASS on a diff the plan clipped, which is why
//              `--diff-truncated` is required and turns one into a FAIL (flow-0103).
//
// Zero dependencies, Node >= 18. `_flow-gates.yml`'s `flow-tooling` job runs
// `node --test .flow/bin/*.test.mjs` with NO install step in front of it, so an import of
// `yaml` here would die before a single test ran. The `review:` scan below is deliberately a
// narrow, tolerant reader of the two shapes config.yml actually uses, not a YAML parser.

// It is a DEFAULT, not a fleet-wide constant (flow-0100). It was effectively the latter: the only

// loudly on it. This is the mirror, and it must be honest rather than loud: the old prompts still
// tell the reviewer to locate the task itself, so degrading to that is correct, while a `task.md`

// `classifyPr` proves WHERE the changed files are — a `flow-sync/` branch, every path inside the
// copied surface. It does not prove WHERE THEY CAME FROM, and those are not the same claim.
// Anyone with write access can name a branch `flow-sync/9.9.9` and put whatever they like under
// `.flow/bin/**`, which is the most sensitive directory in an adopting repo: every file in it
// executes in that repo's CI. Raised as a security FAIL on canonical's PR #146, which answered the
// PROMPT half — every reviewer still READS a sync PR, and fails one that widens `permissions:`,
// introduces `pull_request_target`, repoints a `uses:` or changes secret handling. This is the
// code half the same review asked for.
//
// The evidence already exists. `_flow-sync.yml` records the canonical commit it built from as a
// `Canonical-SHA:` trailer on the sync commit (flow-0075), so the claim is CHECKABLE: fetch
// canonical at that commit and compare every changed file with the file the sync would have
// copied over it. All of them match → classify, exactly as before. Anything else — one file
// edited after the sync, no trailer, two different trailers, a fetch that failed — does not
// classify, and the PR falls back to the ordinary task-less handling where all three reviewers
// read it in full.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED, and note which way that points. The cost of refusing to classify a genuine sync is
// one PR reviewed the way every other PR is reviewed; the cost of classifying a forged one is a
// fixed PASS line on code nobody read. So every uncertainty resolves to "not classified",
// including the uncertainties that are far more likely to be infrastructure than attack.

// Where canonical lives — the same repository `_flow-sync.yml` clones. Two decisions here:
//
//   NOT A CONFIG KEY. A repo able to point this at its own fork could satisfy the check against a
//   tree it controls, which is the check deleting itself.
//   NOT A SECOND LITERAL. `flow-init` already defines the canonical repository, and that is the
//   definition; this derives the clone URL from it. A typed copy is the flow-0058 hazard — the
//   one constant left pointing at the old place after everything else moved, indistinguishable
