// flow-review.test.mjs — proving tests for the deterministic half of the review gate (flow-0007).
//
// The model call is not the gate; these functions are. Two failure modes matter more than the
// rest and both are asserted in the fail-closed direction:
//
//   · a reviewer that produced no verdict, an empty one, or unparseable JSON must FAIL the
//     check. Reading any of those as a pass would make the whole gate theatre, and it is the
//     mode that shows up exactly when something already went wrong.
//   · a repo that has not scoped `review.security_paths` must get the security review on every
//     PR, not none of them.
//   · a reviewer that was handed a TRUNCATED diff must not be able to clear the check with a
//     PASS (flow-0103). Same shape as the two above: the gate would look green having graded
//     part of a change.
//
// Zero dependencies on purpose: `_flow-gates.yml`'s `flow-tooling` job runs
// `node --test .flow/bin/*.test.mjs` with no install step, so anything imported here has to be
// in Node itself.
